/**
 * {@code PaymentServiceFactory} provides static factory methods to create ready-to-use
 * instances of {@link PaymentService} implementations.
 * <p>
 * The returned service instances are dynamically proxied using {@link PaymentServiceProxy},
 * but this complexity is abstracted away from the consumer. The client code simply receives a
 * {@code PaymentService} instance and can invoke operations without knowing or caring about
 * the underlying proxy logic.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>This design promotes cleaner code and separation of concerns â€” allowing additional
 * behaviors (e.g., logging, validation, metrics) to be injected transparently via proxy
 * without burdening the business logic.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Usage Example:</strong></p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * PaymentService service = PaymentServiceFactory.getDefaultPaymentService();
 * service.process();
 * }</pre>
